#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)0(log n) Because it just a while loop with a condition. So the size of input increases the runtime space will grow too, slower.


b) This one is 0(n log n) because there is a while loop inside a for loop.


c) I think this one is Linear 0(n) because it iterates (recursively ) depending on the size of the input.

## Exercise II
